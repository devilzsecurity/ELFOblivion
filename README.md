# ELFOblivion
ELFOblivion is a cutting-edge anti-reversing tool designed to make ELF binaries nearly impossible to analyze. By strategically corrupting critical ELF structures—such as the ELF header, section headers, and symbol table—this tool disrupts static analysis while still allowing the binary to execute under normal conditions.
